          <li>Contained within an image element are many attributes to include (src, alt, width, and height).</li>
          <li>The (src) or source attribute is the most important because it defines the location of the image.</li>
          <li>The (alt) or alternate attribute provides text for screen readers and other assistive technologies.</li>
          <li>The (br) or break element creates a line of empty space between two blocks of content.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>

        <ul>

          <li>Three ways to style a webpage using CSS include inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet.</li>
          <li>A link element allows you to connect your external CSS style sheet to your HTML file and is included in the head element along with the rest of your meta data.</li>
          <li>CSS Rule: Selector to define the element or attribute to which rules, or declarations, will apply. Selector examples include header, footer, and h1 to name a few.</li>
          <li>CSS Rule: Declaration which includes the property and the value, for example, the property being color and the value being blue.</li>
          <li>Other examples of declarations that can be made include margin, padding, width, height, background-color, text-align, display, and font-size to name a few.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>You can also apply declarations to multiple elements at once rather than retyping uneccessary code. This can be done by using a simple comma between elements. Ex. h1,h2 {declaration}</li>
          <li>You can also designate a class attribute as the selector which can allow you to assign styles to certain elements, but not all the elements. Ex. using the class, card, within CSS along with the specific properties and values, then placing the class attribute within the selection element of your HTML file. </li>
