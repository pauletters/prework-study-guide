        <h2>HTML</h2>

        <ul>

          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>The title element defines the title for a webpage.</li>
          <li>The style element defines the CSS styles associated with a website.</li>
          <li>The base element defines the base URL for a webpage.</li>
          <li>The link element connects an external resource to the HTML document.</li>
          <li>The meta element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewpoint.</li>
          <li>The script element embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document.</li>
          <li>The h1-h6 elements represent the level of heading a given text block represents. They should always start with h1 and it should only be used once per page.</li>
          <li>The paragraph (p) element represents a block of text used on a webpage.</li>
          <li>The (ul,ol, and li) elements represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items respectively. Represented as either bullets or numbered lists.</li>
          <li>The (img) element contains information about images that are displayed on the webpage.</li>
          <li>Contained within an image element are many attributes to include (src, alt, width, and height).</li>
          <li>The (src) or source attribute is the most important because it defines the location of the image.</li>
          <li>The (alt) or alternate attribute provides text for screen readers and other assistive technologies.</li>
          <li>The (br) or break element creates a line of empty space between two blocks of content.</li>
          <li>Section elements are semantic elements that define a section in a document that contains thematic content. They are found within the body under the main element.</li>
          <li>The footer element appears at the bottom of the page and usually contains the author, copyright, contact, sitemap, and navigation.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>

        <ul>

          <li>Three ways to style a webpage using CSS include inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet.</li>
          <li>A link element allows you to connect your external CSS style sheet to your HTML file and is included in the head element along with the rest of your meta data.</li>
          <li>CSS Rule: Selector to define the element or attribute to which rules, or declarations, will apply. Selector examples include header, footer, and h1 to name a few.</li>
          <li>CSS Rule: Declaration which includes the property and the value, for example, the property being color and the value being blue.</li>
          <li>Other examples of declarations that can be made include margin, padding, width, height, background-color, text-align, display, and font-size to name a few.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>You can also apply declarations to multiple elements at once rather than retyping uneccessary code. This can be done by using a simple comma between elements. Ex. h1,h2 {declaration}</li>
          <li>You can also designate a class attribute as the selector which can allow you to assign styles to certain elements, but not all the elements. Ex. using the class, card, within CSS along with the specific properties and values, then placing the class attribute within the selection element of your HTML file. </li>

        <h2>Git</h2>

        <ul>

          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li>git add: adds the changed files in your working directory to the staging area of Git.</li>
          <li>git commit: commits your staged changes to your repository.</li>
          <li>git pull origin main: tells you whether your current branch is up to date or not. Good to do before opening a pull request.</li>
          <li>git push origin: pushes up all of your changes within branch specified.</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>

        <ul>

          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script. In JavaScript it always flows from top to bottom.</li>
          <li>One way to declare a variable is through the keyword 'const' which "locks down" what you want the variable to be and can never be reassigned.</li>
          <li>We use an '=' to assign the data we want stored in our variable. Ex. const shape = "circle";</li>
          <li>You can use the console.log mwethod to output a message to the web console by adding an argument. Ex. console.log(topics);</li>
          <li>We can use conditional statements and loops to control the order in which code is executed, or if it is even executed at all.</li>
          <li>An 'if' statement is a way of introducing decision-making into our code. When using an 'if' statement, code will only execute if the statement meets a condition, or is true.</li>
          <li>'If' statement example: if (condition) { //block of code to be executed if condition is truthy }</li>
          <li>You can also use the statement 'else if' to create more than one condition.</li>
          <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Arrays are typically used to hold data that is related in some way. Ex. const shapes = ["triangle", "square", "pentagon", "circle"];</li>
          <li>Arrays are not limited to contain only a single type of data. A single array can store different types of data, such as strings, numbers, and so on. Ex. const studentInfo = ["Lu", 54, true];</li>
          <li>To work with individual data items inside an array, we need to have one more piece of information: the location of the data item in the array. This location is identified with a unique number called an index.</li>
          <li>Using each piece of data's index, or location number, we can access individual data inside the array.</li>
          <li>Arrays are zero-indexed and sequential. Meaning they start with 0 and move up by 1 each time.</li>
          <li>A 'for' loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perfform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over. Ex. for(let x = 0; < shapes.length; x++) { // code block }</li>
          <li>A function is a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task. Ex. function helloWorld() { // code block }</li>
          <li>The console tab of Chrome DevTools is a great resource for debugging your code.</li>
